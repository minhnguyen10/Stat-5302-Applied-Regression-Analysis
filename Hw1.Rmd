## Chapter 1

### Problem 1.3

#### 1.3.1
- Based on the figure 1.12, there might be no dependence at all between Average soil temperature and number of Months after January 1976

#### 1.3.2
- Here is the graph of Average soil temperature and number of Months after January 1976 after resizing it to make the length of the horizontal axis at least 4 times the length of the vertical axis (using the mouse to drag)
```{r mitchell}
#data('Mitchell')
#plot(Temp ~ Month, Mitchell, xlab="Months after January 1976",
#     ylab="Average soil tempreture")
include_graphics('figure1-3.png')
```

- By looking at the graph, we can conclude that there might be a temporal
pattern between Average soil temperature and number of Months after January 1976. We might guess that the Average soil temperature is high in the summer and low in the winter


### Problem  1.6
##### Quality:
- In the scatter matrix in figure 1.13, each plot in the scatterplot matrix is relevant to a particular one predictor regression of the the variable on the vertical axis, given the variable on the horizontal axis. 
- For example, the plot of Quality versus Clarity in the top row and
second column of the scatterplot matrix in Figure 1.13 shows that Quality is linearly relevant to the Clarity. We can draw a simple regression line between those variable. We get the overall impression that Quality increases on the Clarity increases, and there is little variation
- We can make similar qualitative judgments about the regressions of Quality on Helpfulness
- The overall impression is that Quality is strongly related to Clarity and Helpfulness

##### Easiness:
- Moreover, the plot of Easiness versus Easiness in the top row and
forth column of the scatterplot matrix in Figure 1.13 shows that Quality is linearly relevant to Easiness. We can draw a simple regression line between those variable. We get the overall impression that Quality increases on the Easiness increases, but there is lot of variation
- We can make similar qualitative judgments about the regressions of Easiness on other variables except raterInterest
- The overall impression is that Easiness is weakly related to other variables in the scatterplot matrix, except raterInterest

##### RateriInterest:
- Finally, the raterInterst does not seem to relate to any other variable in the scatter matrix.



## Chapter 2:
### Problem 2.1
#### 2.1.1
```{r 2.1.1}
data('Htwt')

plot(wt ~ ht, data=Htwt)
```

- A simple linear regression model is somewhat make sense for these data, because there only 10 points. However, those points are generally increasing from right to left. 

#### 2.1.2
```{r 2.1.2}
X <- Htwt$ht
Y <- Htwt$wt
n <- length(X)
x_bar <- sum(X)/n
y_bar <- sum(Y)/n
SXX <- sum((X - x_bar)**2)
SYY <- sum((Y - y_bar)**2)
SXY <- sum((X - x_bar)*(Y - y_bar))
Beta_hat_1 <- SXY/SXX
Beta_hat_0 <- y_bar - Beta_hat_1*x_bar

print(c(Xbar=x_bar, Ybar=y_bar, SXX=SXX, SYY=SYY, SXY=SXY))
print(c(Intercept=Beta_hat_0, Slope=Beta_hat_1))
plot(wt ~ ht, data=Htwt)
abline(Beta_hat_0, Beta_hat_1)
```

#### 2.1.3
```{r 2.1.3}
RSS <- SYY - SXY**2/SXX
s2 <- RSS/(n-2)
s <- sqrt(s2)
print(RSS)
print(c(s2=s2, s=s))

#std error coef
se_Beta_hat_1 <- sqrt(s2/SXX)
se_Beta_hat_0 <- sqrt(s2*(1/n +x_bar**2/SXX))
print(c(SE_Intercept=se_Beta_hat_0, SE_Slope=se_Beta_hat_1))
#cov
covariance <- -s2*x_bar/SXX
print(covariance)
#t test
t_Beta_hat_1 <- (Beta_hat_1 - 0)/se_Beta_hat_1
t_Beta_hat_0 <- (Beta_hat_0 - 0)/se_Beta_hat_0
print(c(t_Beta_hat_1, t_Beta_hat_0))
#p value
p_Beta_hat_1 <- 2 * pt( abs(t_Beta_hat_1), df = n-2, lower.tail = FALSE )
p_Beta_hat_0 <- 2 * pt( abs(t_Beta_hat_0), df = n-2, lower.tail = FALSE )
print(c(p_Beta_hat_1, p_Beta_hat_0))
```
```{r rtyrty}
summary(lm(wt ~ ht,Htwt))
```

### Problem 2.2
#### 2.2.1
- The key different between points above this line (y=x) and the point below the line is that the points above the line have y > x, while the points bellow the line have y < x (since the scales on both axes are the same)
- In other word, the points above the line (y=x) rice price in 2009 higher than the rice price in 2003, and vice versa

#### 2.2.2
- Vilnius had the largest increase in rice price
- Mumbai had the largest decrease in rice price

#### 2.2.3
- No since the $\hat{\beta}_1$ might be greater than 0

#### 2.2.4
- Does not show any trend overtime
- They do not have any relationship
